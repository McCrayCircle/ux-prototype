# ux-prototype

Goals: 

1) Provide an easy, fast and unambiguous way to explore UX flows and designs for OpenUnited.com

2) Create simple and precise requirements for full-stack developers, with work in this repo acting as an efficient and effective "handover" from a UX/Web designer to a full-stack developer.
     
3) As part of the UX work, co-create and align with real data concepts, flows and html templates that will be used in the production codebase, such that the work in this repo can be enriched and tweaked to be useful in production.
